== Create a development environment. == #create_dev_env
Nitrate is standard Django app. The deployment method is the same as others.

=== Download the sources. === #download_source
The Nitrate source code is available at:
https://fedorahosted.org/nitrate/browser/trunk/nitrate/

You can easy to get the latest changes with git:
{{{
# git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/nitrate.git
}}}

Or you also can download the tarballs and rpms from:
https://fedorahosted.org/nitrate/browser/branches/nitrate/

=== Generate the configuration file. === #generate_config_file
We recommend you to create a new settings file based on nitrate/tcms/settings.py
file for develop environment or production environment. As you can see the
settings.py file contains default/safest configurations, create another settings
file contains the configurations you private will be more better than modify the
default settings.

At this moment, I presume the file you write named 'dev_settings.py', place the
file to the same path as settings.py.

You may need to modify following contents, for more, reference the settings.py:

{{{
# Database settings

DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'     # 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql',
                                # 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
DATABASE_NAME = 'dev.db'        # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
DATABASE_USER = ''              # Not used with sqlite3.
DATABASE_PASSWORD = ''          # Not used with sqlite3.
DATABASE_HOST = ''              # Set to empty string for localhost.
                                # Not used with sqlite3.
DATABASE_PORT = ''              # Set to empty string for default.
                                # Not used with sqlite3.

# Local time zone for this installation. Choices can be found here:
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones_by_name
# although not all choices may be available on all operating systems.
# If running in a Windows environment this must be set to the same as your
# system time zone.
TIME_ZONE = 'Asia/Shanghai'

# Mail settings

# Set the default send mail address
# See http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#email-backend
EMAIL_HOST = ''
EMAIL_PORT = 25
EMAIL_FROM = 'noreply@foo.com'
EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX = '[TCMS] '

# First run - to detemine need port user or not.
FIRST_RUN = True

# The URLS will be list in footer
# Example:
#FOOTER_LINKS = (
#   ('mailto:nitrate-dev-list@example.com', 'Contact Us'),
#   ('mailto:nitrate-admin@example.com', 'Request Permission'),
#   ('http://foo.com', 'foo')
#)
FOOTER_LINKS = ()
}}}

=== Initial database schema. === #initial_db
Database is required by Nitrate(and all of Django apps). The Django ORM supports
many database backends, we recommend you to use MySQL(In fact it's a bug so far).

We provided two SQL file for usage.

Empty testopia dumps file:
https://fedorahosted.org/nitrate/browser/trunk/nitrate/docs/testopia-dump-blank.sql

Nitrate upgrade dumps file:
https://fedorahosted.org/nitrate/browser/trunk/nitrate/docs/mysql_initial.sql

First you need define the mysql database configuration in dev_settings.py file.
Then download and import the database dumps files, I presume the database named
'nitrate'.
{{{
$ mysql -u [db_username] -p nitrate < testopia-dump-blank.sql
$ mysql -u [db_username] -p nitrate < mysql_initial.sql
}}}
Then use the django-admin syncdb to initial the data.
{{{
$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=tcms.dev_settings
}}}
If you are install from git source you need to define the env as following:
$ export PYTHONPATH=[nitrate_download_path]/nitrate/trunk/nitrate/
{{{
$ django-admin syncdb
}}}
=== Start the Django app. === #start_app
After upon steps completed, now you can try to start the web server built-in
Django to testing the app running.

Define the envs again if you does not completed the steps, it should confirm the
envs exist in system before start the server.
{{{
$ cd [nitrate_download_path]/nitrate/trunk/nitrate/
$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=tcms.dev_settings
$ export PYTHONPATH=[nitrate_download_path]/nitrate/trunk/nitrate/

$ django-admin runserver
}}}
Then try to use web browser to open http://localhost:8000/ to see the web service
working status.

== Extra installation steps deployed with Apache. == #extra_apache
We recommend to use the WSGI method, it saves resources and very fast. The sample
is located at:
https://fedorahosted.org/nitrate/browser/trunk/nitrate/contrib/conf/nitrate-httpd.conf

Take care the config file enabled mod_auth_kerb authentication, you may need to
comment the settings starts with 'Auth' and 'Krb' at first.

Then place the file to /etc/httpd/conf.d/ and modify the files path from default
to you specific should be OK.

=== Deployed with mod_auth_kerb. === #extra_apache_mod_auth_kerb
First you need to request the keytab file and a /etc/krb5.conf from your KDC
administrators at first, place the keytab file to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.keytab
and place the krb5.conf file into /etc.

Then modify the Nitrate product settings file. I recommend you to create another
settings file inherit from dev_settings.py to disable DEBUG options and other
configuration settings you need in production environment, I presume new settings
file named 'product_settings.py' here.

Then modify the authentication backends settings in the file as following:
{{{
# Authentication backends

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'tcms.core.contrib.auth.backends.ModAuthKerbBackend',
)
}}}

Then restart the web server should be done.

== Extra installation steps deployed with Nginx. == #extra_nginx
With benchmark, we found Nginx + FCGI is faster than Apache + Mod_python, To use
the Nginix to deploy the Nitrate will be a good idea for production environment.

The configuration sample located at:
https://fedorahosted.org/nitrate/browser/trunk/nitrate/contrib/conf/nitrate-nginx.conf

The file is very initial, and patches are welcome.

== Migration from old testopia. == #migrate_testopia
Because of Nitrate schema is compatible with testopia, it makes migrate the data
from testopia is possible.

The steps is most the same as the texts in section 'Initial database schema.', 
The different is import the empty dumps steps is not needed. Just made the
Nitrate settings point the DB settings to running testopia database, then run
following steps should be OK.
{{{
$ mysql -u [db_username] -p [testopia_db_name] < mysql_initial.sql
}}}
Then use the django-admin syncdb to initial the data.
{{{
$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=tcms.dev_settings
}}}
If you are install from git source you need to define the env as following:
$ export PYTHONPATH=[nitrate_download_path]/nitrate/trunk/nitrate/
{{{
$ django-admin syncdb
}}}
Because of Nitrate supports multiple bug tracker system, you may need to initial
the bugzilla URL like following:
{{{
$ mysql -u [db_username] -p
mysql> USE [testopia_db_name]
mysql> INSERT INTO test_case_bug_systems (name, url_reg_exp) values ('Bugzilla', 'https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=%s');
mysql> UPDATE test_case_bugs SET bug_system_id = 1;
}}}
The bugzilla(testopia) can keep running, just modify the 'url_reg_exp' column
for bugzilla as the bugzilla(testopia) URL.
