1.2. Coding style
-----------------

Please follow these coding standards when writing code for inclusion in Nitrate.

1.2.1. Python style
-------------------

* Unless otherwise specified, follow `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_.
* Use underscores, not camelCase, for variable, function and method names (i.e. poll.get_unique_voters(), not poll.getUniqueVoters).
* In docstrings, use “action words” such as:

    code::

        def foo():
            """
            Calculates something and returns the result.
            """
            pass

    Here’s an example of what not to do:

    code::

        def foo():
            """
            Calculate something and return the result.
            """
            pass

    More details please follow `Django's development version <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/>`_.
